# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-TRACKING-WITH-TILT-FEATURE
This is made for identifying the Ball as the object and to track the ball using tilt feature.  Where I used Raspberry pi and TensorFlow where I used the trained ball function and used  Arduino to identify the signal to rotate the servo motor for tilt feature.

Description:

Developed a system designed to identify and track a ball object using a tilt feature.
Utilized Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow frameworks for implementation.
Employed a trained ball function to accurately detect and identify the ball object.
Integrated Arduino to receive signals and control a servo motor for the tilt functionality.
Implemented tilt adjustments based on real-time ball tracking data.
Ensured seamless communication and coordination between Raspberry Pi, TensorFlow, and Arduino components.
Conducted rigorous testing and calibration to optimize the system's accuracy and responsiveness.

Skills utilized:

Raspberry Pi programming
TensorFlow implementation
Object detection and tracking
Arduino programming for signal processing and servo motor control
System integration and communication
