# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-TRACKING-WITH-TILT-FEATURE
This is made for identifying the Ball as the object and to track the ball using tilt feature.  Where I used Raspberry pi and TensorFlow where I used the trained ball function and used  Arduino to identify the signal to rotate the servo motor for tilt feature.
